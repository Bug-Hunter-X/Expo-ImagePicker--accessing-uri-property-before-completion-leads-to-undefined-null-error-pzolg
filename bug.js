This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected image object before the asynchronous operations associated with image selection have completed. This leads to the `uri` property being undefined or null, resulting in errors when attempting to use the image URI. This is an asynchronous operation, and developers often make the mistake of trying to access the URI synchronously.
