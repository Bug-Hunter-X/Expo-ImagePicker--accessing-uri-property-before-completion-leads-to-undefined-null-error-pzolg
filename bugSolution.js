The solution involves using Promises or async/await to ensure the `uri` property is accessed only after the image selection process is complete.  Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

async function pickImage() {
  let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync();
  if (!result.cancelled) {
    console.log(result.uri); // Access uri after selection is complete
  }
}
```
This improved version uses `async/await`, ensuring the code waits for the ImagePicker's asynchronous operation to finish before accessing `result.uri`.  The `console.log` will only execute after the URI is available.
